# Embedded Lab

A personal collection of embedded systems experiments, code snippets, and learning resources. This repository serves as a log of my progress, a reference for past work, and a source of motivation to see how far I've come.

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains various embedded programming exercises, firmware prototypes, and small tests. The code is organized into folders based on different categories of embedded systems work.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BiltuDas1/embedded-lab.git
   ```
2. **Explore the code** by navigating through the folders.
3. **Use an appropriate IDE** (e.g., Arduino IDE, PlatformIO) to edit and flash the code.

## 🛠 Technologies & Languages

- **C++** – Primary language for firmware development.
- **Python** – Used occasionally for scripting and testing.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- Code is organized based on different embedded platforms.
- Each folder contains relevant source files, scripts, and notes.

## 📜 Notes

- Some code may be experimental, incomplete, or used for testing concepts.
- The repository will continue evolving as I explore more embedded topics.
